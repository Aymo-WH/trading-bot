"""Phase 3 M0 combiner (design.md §6-7; frozen construction in
specs/EXP-002-phase3-m0-combiner.md, amended per the no-trade-band scope
correction below). Provider contract for `validation.run_battery`:
``m0_provider(prices, config) -> {"weights", "signal"}``.

Construction: equal-weight composite of S1 (momentum) + S2 (TS trend), made
dollar-neutral AND beta-neutral by taking the cross-sectional OLS residual
against rolling beta (exact identity: the residual sums to zero and is
orthogonal to beta, per date, before any clipping, PROVIDED the composite
and beta NaN masks coincide -- see `neutralize_against_beta`), then
z-scored, clipped at +/-2.5, and turned into weights via iterative
position/category-cap waterfilling to a 200% gross target. All signal math
above is point-in-time (reuses `src.signals`, already tested); this module
adds only the combiner + portfolio-construction layer.

Turnover control (the no-trade band) is deferred to Phase 4 alongside
vol-targeting and the drawdown brake (charter §5 assigns "turnover control"
to Phase 4, not Phase 3) -- `apply_no_trade_band`/`_freeze_small_changes`
remain here, tested, for that reuse, but are NOT invoked by
`compute_signal_and_weights`. A prior version called it inside Phase 3's
pipeline; an independent code review found that interaction reintroduced real
cap violations (up to 1.34% of gross) via an unsanctioned post-freeze
rescale not in the frozen spec. Removing the call eliminates the bug at its
source rather than patching around it (see decisions.md D26)."""
