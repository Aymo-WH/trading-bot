class PBOValidator:
    """
    Implements Combinatorially Symmetric Cross-Validation (CSCV) to compute the
    Probability of Backtest Overfitting (PBO).

    This technique estimates the likelihood that a model's optimal performance in-sample
    was purely due to noise, rather than true signal, by generating thousands of
    recombinations of the performance matrix and evaluating their corresponding out-of-sample ranks.

        Initializes the PBO Validator.

        Args:
            performance_matrix (np.ndarray): Shape (Trials, Timesteps), where each row
                is the historical performance of a tested hyperparameter set.
            num_partitions (int): Number of chunks (S) to split the timeline into.

        Calculates the Probability of Backtest Overfitting.

        Splits the performance matrix into `S` equal parts, forms `S/2` training
        recombinations (IS) and corresponding testing recombinations (OOS). Finds the
        trial that performs best IS, and evaluates its percentile rank OOS. The PBO
        is the percentage of recombinations where the IS winner performs worse than
        the median (rank < 0.5) in the OOS set.
